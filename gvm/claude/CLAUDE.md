## Writing prose

- **Never** use "load-bearing" as a metaphor. It applies to walls and beams, not
  to code, config, SHAs, assumptions or arguments. Say "important" — it does the
  job without the affectation. Applies everywhere: docs, commit messages, code
  comments, PR descriptions and chat.

## Writing code

- Do not add lengthy comments explaining what code does.
- Comments added should explain reasons that would not be obvious from reading the code
- Respect existing comments - only remove them if your change means they're no longer true or relevant

## Running code

- please use 'docker compose' instead of docker-compose
- Worktrees are isolated environments for separate tasks. Never use resources (databases, containers, ports) from one worktree in another. Only use the DB/services running for the current checkout.
- When agents need to run git commands in a directory that is NOT their current working directory, use `git -C /path` instead of `cd /path && git`. This avoids requiring user approval for every `cd` command. If the repo is already the working directory, just run `git` directly.
- **Don't run the full test suite locally before pushing.** Run the tests for the code you changed, plus typecheck and lint, then push and let CI run the full suite. Never hold up a push or PR waiting on a full local run. If a local run fails in files you didn't touch, treat it as environmental and move on rather than re-running to prove it. Only run the full suite locally when asked or when CI fails in a way that points at your change.

## Version control

- **Before writing any code**, check you are on an appropriate branch. If you need a new branch, create it from main (or the correct base) first. Never make changes on an unrelated branch.
- Always follow the `commit-style` skill when creating git commits.
- Always use the `pr` skill when creating pull requests.
- **Never rewrite shared history.** Once a commit has been pushed, add new commits rather than amending it. Amending or rewording local, unpushed commits is fine. Preserving individual commit history is preferred over a clean single commit. Force push should only be used for rebasing.
- On GitHub auth failures (git or gh: permission denied, bad credentials, missing scope), stop. Don't try to work around them with other remotes, protocols, tokens or accounts; report the exact error to the user.
- When creating git worktrees, always use flat directory names — no slashes. Flatten branch names with dashes, e.g. `../repo_worktree_feature_branch-name` not `../repo_worktree_feature/branch-name`.

## This box's own config

- This box is disposable and rebuilt from scratch about weekly. Anything not pushed (repo clones, branches, Claude's memory) is lost.
- Your instructions, settings, hooks and skills live in `~/personal/dotfiles/gvm/claude/`, linked into `~/.claude`. Change them there, then commit and push; nothing outside the box needs touching.
- `~/.claude/CLAUDE.md` belongs to gvm, which rewrites it on every `gvm up`; it imports this file. Don't edit it.
- `gvm/provision.d/*` runs on every `gvm up` and on a rebuild. Put setup the box should always have there (a tool, a clone), and keep each script safe to run again.
- Files under `home/` are shared with Ed's Mac. Put box-only changes under `gvm/`.

## Work Brain — knowledge capture

- A zettelkasten-style knowledge base lives at `~/personal/work-brain/`.
- **You MUST proactively write work-brain notes. Do not wait to be asked.** This is as important as committing code.
- **When working on a Linear ticket**: create or update `journal/tasks/<ticket-id>.md` at the start of the task. Record decisions, PR numbers, gotchas, and anything someone picking this up later would need. Update it as you go.
- **When working without a ticket**: create `journal/adhoc/<YYYY-MM-DD-descriptive_name>.md` for anything worth remembering — debugging sessions, architectural decisions, tool patterns, non-obvious gotchas.
- Read the `CLAUDE.md` in that repo for frontmatter format and guidelines.
- You can write to work-brain from any project — use `git -C ~/personal/work-brain` for git operations and absolute paths for file writes.
- Commit and push notes as you go. Use the commit-style skill. These are low-stakes commits — don't overthink them.
- The `learning/` directory contains distilled notes; don't write there directly during normal work — a periodic skill handles that.
